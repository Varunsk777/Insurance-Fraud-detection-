Fraud Detection Dashboard
This project provides an interactive dashboard for fraud detection using Streamlit. It allows users to upload a CSV file, preprocess the data, visualize it, and train a Random Forest Classifier to detect fraudulent claims. Additionally, a Jupyter notebook is included to generate synthetic fraud data and train a model.
Features

Upload and View Dataset: Upload a CSV file and view its contents.
Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale features.
Visualizations: Generate correlation heatmaps, pairplots, and target distribution plots.
Model Training: Perform train-test split and train a Random Forest Classifier.
Model Evaluation: Display classification report, confusion matrix, and ROC-AUC score.

Installation
To install the required dependencies, run:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
Running the Dashboard
To launch the Streamlit dashboard, execute:
streamlit run dashboard.py

Then, open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8501 to interact with the dashboard.
Generating Synthetic Data
The Jupyter notebook Fraud detection.ipynb generates synthetic fraud data and trains a model. To use it:

Open the notebook in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
Run the cells to generate the data, preprocess it, and train the model.

Note: The notebook saves the preprocessed data to data.csv, which can be uploaded to the dashboard for analysis.

Data
The dashboard accepts any CSV file with columns suitable for fraud detection. The synthetic data generated by the notebook includes:

Customer ID: Unique identifier for each customer.
Age: Age of the policyholder.
Annual Income: Policyholder's annual income.
Region: Geographical region of the policyholder.
Policy ID: Unique policy identifier.
Policy Term: Duration of the policy in years.
Premium Amount: Amount paid for insurance coverage.
Coverage Amount: Total coverage amount.
Previous Claims Count: Number of prior claims.
Policy Age: Age of the policy in years.
Claim ID: Unique claim identifier.
Claim Date: Date the claim was filed.
Claim Amount: Amount requested in the claim.
Report Delay: Days between incident and claim report.
Claim Status: Status of the claim (e.g., Pending, Approved, Rejected).
High-Value Claim: Indicator for high-value claims (0 or 1).
Multiple Claims Indicator: Indicates multiple claims (0 or 1).
Suspicious Region: Flags suspicious regions (0 or 1).
Inconsistent Information: Flags inconsistent claim data (0 or 1).
Third-Party Involvement: Indicates third-party involvement (0 or 1).
Fraudulent: Target variable (0 for non-fraudulent, 1 for fraudulent).
Engineered Features: Includes Claim to Premium Ratio, Income to Coverage Ratio, Policy Age Group, and High Risk Region.
